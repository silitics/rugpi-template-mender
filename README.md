# Rugpi: Quick Start Template for Mender

This template shows how to build a Rugpi image with Mender integration.

For general information about Rugpi and how to use it, check out [Rugpi's documentation](https://oss.silitics.com/rugpi/docs/getting-started).

## üîß Configuration

To configure Mender, you need your Mender tenant token.
Note that this token, as any secret, should not be committed to Git.
For this reason, we use a `.env` file for secrets.
To configure the token, copy the `env.template` file to `.env` and replace the placeholder with your actual token.
In addition, you may need to change the server URL in the [`mender.conf`](recipes/mender/files/mender.conf) configuration file and put your public SSH key in [`layers/customized.toml`](layers/customized.toml).

## üèóÔ∏è Building Images

To build an image for Raspberry Pi 4, including the necessary firmware update:

```bash
./run-bakery bake image pi4 build/pi4.img
```

To build an image for Raspberry Pi 5 or 4, without the firmware update:

```bash
./run-bakery bake image tryboot build/tryboot.img
```

To create a Mender artifact from the produced `tryboot` image:

```bash
VERSION=$(date +'%Y%m%d.%H%M')
mender-artifact write module-image \
    -n "Image ${VERSION}" \
    -t raspberrypi4 \
    -T rugpi-image \
    -f build/tryboot.img \
    -o build/${VERSION}.mender \
    --software-name "Mender Template" \
    --software-version "${VERSION}"
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Remarks

### GitHub Actions

This repository contains a workflow for GitHub Actions which builds both images (with and without the firmware update for Raspberry Pi 4) and a Mender artifact.
To inject the Mender tenant token, you need to create a GitHub Actions secret named `ENV` and put the contents of the `.env` file there.
Note that the build artifacts contain the token and are thus not uploaded by default.
If you want to extract the artifacts, uncomment the respective section in the workflow.
**Make sure your repository is private in order to not leak the token.**

### Simple SBOM

As part of the image building process, a simple *software bill of materials* (SBOM) is generated.
The SBOM is stored in `build/customized.sbom.txt` and also included in the build artifacts of the GitHub Actions workflow.
